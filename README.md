# appointments-api
A REST api for managing appointments of patients


## Technologies

- Java 8
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data
- MockMvc and JUnit
- MongoDB 
- Maven

Obs:. Assuming that Rest maturity model level 2 is ok for the purpose of the code exercise.


## How to run

1 - Make sure you have properly installed Java 8 and Maven.
2 - Open the file "src\main\resources\application.properties" and set your profile. 
2.1 - profile-dev is for embedded mongodb 
2.2 - profile-prod is for external mongodb which the configuration is at "src\main\resources\application-profile-prod.properties" (default)
3 - Open your command window, go to the project's root folder (/appointments-api) and run "mvn clean package"
4 - Once the build is run with success, jump ahead to the target folder and type "java -jar appointments-api-0.1.0.jar" and that's it. Tomcat is already embedded by the spring boot.
